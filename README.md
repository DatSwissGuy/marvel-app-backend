# MarvelApp (Backend Only)

This is the backend / REST API for an educational Angular SPA consuming 2 RESTful APIs: The official Marvel API and a custom made API (Laravel). The Frontend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DatSwissGuy/marvel-app-frontend)

This project was originally generated with Laravel 6.

This REST API was created during my internship at [Liip](https://www.liip.ch)

# Full Application
