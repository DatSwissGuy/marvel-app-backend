# MarvelApp (Backend Only)

This is the Backend for an educational Angular SPA consuming 2 RESTful APIs: The official Marvel API and a custom made API (Laravel). The Frontend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/DatSwissGuy/marvel-app-frontend. 

This project was originally generated with Laravel 6.

This REST Api was created during my internship at [Liip](https://www.liip.ch)
